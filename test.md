# MEMORANDUM

**To:** Executive Leadership Team, Arista Healthcare Insurance  
**From:** Jane Clark, Vice President of Strategic Innovation  
**Date:** January 13, 2025  
**Subject:** Recommendation to Invest in Remote Monitoring Devices to Reduce Emergency Room Utilization

## I. Executive Summary

This memo outlines our recommendation to invest in remote patient monitoring (RPM) devices in order to reduce unnecessary emergency room (ER) visits and prevent unplanned inpatient admissions. Multiple independent studies and internal data indicate that integrating RPM into our coverage offerings will generate substantial cost savings through proactive management of chronic and high-risk patients. Given the expected return on investment (ROI), improved patient outcomes, and enhanced member satisfaction, we strongly recommend immediate capital allocation for a pilot program followed by a phased rollout.

Our comprehensive analysis projects a 15% reduction in ER visits among enrolled members, translating to approximately $3.2 million in savings during the first year of deployment. Furthermore, the program aligns with our strategic objectives of transitioning to value-based care models and maintaining competitive advantage in an increasingly digital healthcare landscape.

## II. Background and Context

• **Rising Costs:** Over the past three fiscal years, Arista Healthcare Insurance has witnessed a 12% increase in per-member ER expenditures and correlated inpatient admissions. These events disproportionately affect our high-risk cohorts (e.g., individuals with congestive heart failure, COPD, and diabetes).

• **Utilization Patterns:** Our FY2024 claims data reveals that 27% of ER visits resulted in inpatient admissions, with an average length of stay of 4.3 days. The top three diagnosis categories driving these admissions were cardiovascular events (32%), respiratory complications (24%), and diabetes-related emergencies (18%).

• **Industry Trends:** Competitors, including BrightWest Assurance and Vitality Health Partners, have already launched successful RPM programs, resulting in notable decreases in their acute care utilization. BrightWest reported a 13.2% reduction in ER visits among their monitored population in Q3 2024.

• **Regulatory Support:** Recent policy updates by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have expanded reimbursement structures for remote patient monitoring, indicating strong regulatory support for innovation in value-based care models. Specifically, the Final Rule published in November 2024 expanded CPT codes for RPM services, increasing potential revenue streams.

• **Member Survey Results:** Our 2024 annual member satisfaction survey indicated that 78% of respondents with chronic conditions would be "somewhat likely" or "very likely" to use remote monitoring tools if covered by their plan.

## III. Strategic Rationale

1. **Cost Savings Through Prevention**  
   By monitoring patients' vitals and health indicators in real time (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, glucose levels), our clinical teams can intervene proactively, preventing complications that otherwise drive up ER usage and inpatient admissions. Historical data from comparable programs indicates intervention potential in 62% of cases before acute deterioration occurs.

2. **Enhanced Patient Engagement and Satisfaction**  
   Digital engagement tools foster stronger patient involvement in their care plans. Improved patient engagement correlates with higher adherence to medication and clinical recommendations, translating to better health outcomes and reduced claims costs. Research indicates that actively engaged patients have 21% lower healthcare costs compared to non-engaged cohorts with similar health profiles.

3. **Competitive Advantage**  
   Our early adoption of an RPM solution will distinguish us in a crowded market. Offering convenient at-home monitoring and telehealth consultations can serve as a key differentiator, potentially attracting and retaining members while reducing costs. Current market penetration of RPM in our service area remains at only 18%, presenting a significant opportunity.

4. **Value-Based Care Alignment**  
   Remote monitoring seamlessly aligns with our broader movement toward value-based care. Through timely interventions, we can reduce readmissions, lower total cost of care, and possibly qualify for CMS and state-level incentive programs. Our value-based contracts currently represent 34% of our book of business, with a strategic target of 65% by 2028.

5. **Data-Driven Care Management**  
   The continuous stream of biometric data from RPM devices will enhance our predictive modeling capabilities, allowing for more precise risk stratification and personalized intervention strategies. This aligns with our five-year digital transformation roadmap established in Q4 2023.

## IV. Recommendation

We propose:

1. **Pilot Program Launch (Q2 2025):**
   * Enroll 2,000 high-risk members (e.g., congestive heart failure, COPD, diabetes) in partnership with TeleCareLink, a leading RPM vendor.
   * Allocate $2.5 million for the pilot, covering device procurement, care coordination tools, and staff training.
   * Measure success metrics (ER utilization rates, 30-day readmissions, patient satisfaction scores) over a 12-month period.
   * Establish a cross-functional governance committee to oversee implementation and evaluate performance metrics.

2. **Phase Two Rollout (Q3 2026):**
   * Gradually expand RPM coverage to an additional 10,000 members, prioritizing populations with high chronic disease burden or risk factors.
   * Invest in scaling internal infrastructure (IT platforms, data analytics, nurse triage lines).
   * Develop specialized monitoring protocols for different condition clusters based on pilot data insights.
   * Implement a dedicated member engagement team to ensure device utilization and troubleshooting support.

3. **Long-Term Integration (2027 and Beyond):**
   * Incorporate remote monitoring capabilities into all relevant care management programs to optimize outcomes across entire lines of business (e.g., Commercial, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid).
   * Finalize multi-year agreements with device manufacturers (e.g., MediCore Solutions, HealthCheck Technologies) to lock in pricing discounts and reduce overhead.
   * Integrate artificial intelligence capabilities to enhance predictive modeling and intervention effectiveness.
   * Explore potential joint ventures with provider networks for revenue-sharing models.

## V. Financial Impact and Expected ROI

• **Immediate Cost Avoidance:** Initial modeling suggests a 15% reduction in ER visits among enrolled pilot members, translating to $3.2 million in savings during the first year of deployment.

• **Long-Term Savings:** A system-wide rollout has the potential to curb acute-care costs by an estimated $28 million annually by Year 4.

• **Break-Even Analysis:** We anticipate recouping our pilot investment within 18–24 months, with increasing returns in subsequent phases as device costs decrease and economies of scale take effect.

• **Capital Requirements:** Total capital expenditure for the pilot phase is projected at $2.5 million, with an additional $8.7 million required for Phase Two expansion.
